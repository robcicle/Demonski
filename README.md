# Demonski

ARCHIVED: 07/03/25
Just to note, this archive date is close to five years after the actual abandonment. The IntroSequence is bugged with WebGL, I attempted to remedy it before finally archiving but seemed to be entirelly unsuccessful. Try the Windows build, it works there! The code in this project is horrendous but a great reminder of the start. :)

Demonski was my first 2D Unity Project, obviously the assets aren't my creations as they were typically taken from [the Unity Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) or [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/) 

A lot of the scripts used don't typically mesh that well with others and there isn't even a GameState manager but this was a project I used to learn my way around the Engine, C#, UI, Audio and all the other stuff.
