# Demonski

ARCHIVED: 07/03/25
This archive date is close to five years after the actual abandonment. All WebGL/UI issues have been resolved and the project will never see another commit. The code in this project is horrendous but a great reminder of the start. :)

Demonski was my first 2D Unity Project, obviously the assets aren't my creations as they were typically taken from [the Unity Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) or [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/) 

A lot of the scripts used don't typically mesh that well with others and there isn't even a GameState manager but this was a project I used to learn my way around the Engine, C#, UI, Audio and all the other stuff.
