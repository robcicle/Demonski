# Demonski

Demonski was my first 2D Unity Project, obviously the assets aren't my creations as they were typically taken from [the Unity Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) or (Open Game Art)https://opengameart.org/ . 

A lot of the scripts used don't typically mesh that well with others and there isn't even a GameState manager but this was a project I used to learn my way around the Engine, C#, UI, Audio and all the other stuff.
